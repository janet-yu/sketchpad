# Sketchpad App

This is a simple sketchpad/drawing web application built with HTML/CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. I learned a lot about manipulation the HTML canvas through this little project, and I'm pretty happy with the results!

# Credits 
This [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/XjJh0q2dBNo?t=2186) really helped with adding the shape tools and undo function as it introduced the concept of canvas ImageData to me and how to save the current canvas image.
